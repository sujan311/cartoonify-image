# Cartoonify Image

**Cartoonify Image** is a simple Python project that allows users to transform ordinary photographs into cartoon-like images. The project utilizes popular image processing techniques and libraries to produce a fun, stylized version of any input photo.

## Features

- Convert regular images into cartoon-style images.
- Easy to use and modify basic script.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy

You can install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sujan311/cartoonify-image.git
    cd cartoonify-image
    ```

2. **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python cartoonify.PY
    ```
    - The script may prompt you to enter the file path of the image you want to cartoonify.
    - Follow any on-screen instructions.

3. **Output:**
    - The cartoonified image will be displayed and/or saved as a new file.

## File Structure

| File           | Description                       |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| cartoonify.PY  | Main script for cartoonify logic. |
| README.md      | Project documentation             |

## How it Works

1. **Image Loading:** Reads the input image.
2. **Image Processing:** Applies smoothing, edge detection, and color quantization.
3. **Cartoon Effect:** Combines processed layers to create a cartoonified result.
